Then, in one dramatic stroke, a divided planet was changed forever. An alien race attacked Earth, and for every nation, every human being, new battle lines were drawn.,\\n  ,HOMEWARD BOUND,\\n,With his epic novels of alternate history, Harry Turtledove shares a stunning vision of what might have beenâ€“and what might still beâ€“if one moment in history were changed. In the ,WorldWar, and ,Colonization, series, an ancient, highly advanced alien species found itself locked in a bitter struggle with a distant, rebellious planetâ€“Earth. For those defending the Earth, this all-out war for survival supercharged human technology, made friends of foes, and turned allies into bitter enemies.,For the aliens known as the Race, the conflict has yielded dire consequences. Mankind has developed nuclear technology years ahead of schedule, forcing the invaders to accept an uneasy truce with nations that possess the technology to defend themselves. But it is the Americans, with their primitive inventiveness, who discover a way to launch themselves through distant spaceâ€“and reach the Raceâ€™s home planet itself.,Nowâ€“in the twenty-first centuryâ€“a few daring men and women embark upon a journey no human has made before. Warriors, diplomats, traitors, and exilesâ€“the humans who arrive in the place called Home find themselves genuine strangers on a strange world, and at the center of a flash point with terrifying potential. For their arrival on the alien home world may drive the enemy to make the ultimate decisionâ€“to annihilate an entire planet, rather than allow the human contagion to spread. It may be that nothing can deter them from this course.,With its extraordinary cast of charactersâ€“human, nonhuman, and some in betweenâ€“,Homeward Bound, is a fascinating contemplation of cultures, armies, and individuals in collision. From the novelist USA Today calls â€œthe leading author of alternate history,â€\\x9d this is a novel of vision, adventure, and constant, astounding surprise.',\n",

He then looks forward at the technological changes we know are coming--from genetics, nanotechnology, robotics, and many other fields--and explores how they will vastly increase wealth, prolong our lifespans, redefine human rights, and alter the social fabric of the world.,Reese explains how the Internet, human ingenuity, and technological innovation will help us forever end the five historic plagues of human existence: ignorance, disease, poverty, hunger, and war. With a rational and researched optimism, Reese sees the future not as a world in a downward spiral, but as destined for progress beyond our imaginations.,As Reese looks forward, he notes that ''we are gaining speed, not winding down.

       "  'description': '\"Competitive Advantage Through People\" explores why - despite long-standing evidence that a committed work force is essential for success - firms continue to attach little importance to their workers. The answer, argues Pfeffer, resides in a complex web of factors based on perception, history, legislation, and practice that continues to dominate management thought and action. Yet, some organizations have been able to overcome these obstacles. In fact, the five common stocks with the highest returns between 1972 and 1992 - Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, Circuit City, and Plenum Publishing - were in industries that shared virtually none of the characteristics traditionally associated with strategic success. What each of these firms did share is the ability to produce sustainable competitive advantage through its way of managing people. Pfeffer documents how they - and others - resisted traditional management pitfalls, and offers frameworks for implementing these changes in any industry.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Discover how the best companies win not by acquiring the right people - but by building the right organization. The \\'war for talent\\' is one battle every company believes it should be waging. But while competitors are busy chasing after the same \\'hot\\' individuals, smart companies are doing something infinitely more useful and far more difficult to copy - they\\'re building organizations that make it possible for ordinary people at every desk and cubicle in their companies to perform as if they were stars. Blowing up the prevailing wisdom that companies must chase and acquire top talent in order to remain successful, \"Hidden Value\" argues instead that the source of sustained competitive advantage already exists within every organization. O\\'Reilly and Pfeffer, leading experts on organizational behavior and human resources, argue that how a firm creates and uses talent is far more important than how the firm attracts talent. The authors provide vivid, detailed case studies of several organizations in widely disparate industries - including Southwest Airlines, Cisco Systems, The Men\\'s Wearhouse, and NUMMI - to illustrate how long-term success comes from value-driven, interrelated systems that align good people management with corporate strategy. In a refreshing break from management tomes that force-feed superficial frameworks and trite \\'rules\\', the authors instead allow the company stories to take center stage. They guide readers in discovering for themselves how seven different firms maximize talent, why one firm hasn\\'t fully released the hidden value in its work force, and, most importantly, how the winning companies have made it tough for competitors to imitate them. Collectively, the stories reveal a common path to success that places values before strategy, emphasizes implementation over planning, and focuses on getting the best out of all employees, not just individual stars. The authors also explore concerns or questions managers might have about how each company\\'s experience parallels or conflicts with their own. Providing a rare opportunity for managers to actively participate in an invaluable learning process, \"Hidden Value\" offers a customizable template for building high-performance, people-centered organizations.',\n",

Dramatic changes in business have unearthed a major gap between traditional approaches to strategy and the way the real world works ,now,.,In short, strategy is stuck. Most leaders are using frameworks that were designed for a different era of business and based on a single dominant ideaâ€”that the purpose of strategy is to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Once the premise on which all strategies were built, this idea is increasingly irrelevant.,Now, Columbia Business School professor and globally recognized strategy expert Rita Gunther McGrath argues that itâ€™s time to go beyond the very concept of sustainable competitive advantage. Instead, organizations need to forge a new path to winning: capturing opportunities fast, exploiting them decisively, and moving on even before they are exhausted. She shows how to do this with a new set of practices based on the notion of ,transient, competitive advantage.,This book serves as a new playbook for strategy, one based on updated assumptions about how the world works, and shows how some of the worldâ€™s most successful companies use this method to compete and win today.,Filled with compelling examples from â€œgrowth outlierâ€\\x9d firms such as Fujifilm, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys, Yahoo!

Pfeffer masterfully builds a powerful business case for managing people effectivelyâ€”not just because it makes for good corporate policy, but because it results in outstanding performance and profits. Challenging current thinking and practice, Pfeffer: reveals the costs of downsizing and provides alternatives; identifies troubling trends in compensation, and suggests better practices; explains why even the smartest managers sometimes manage people unwisely; demonstrates how market-based forces can fail to create good people management practices, creating a need for positive public policy; and provides practical guidelines for implementing high-performance management practices.

Honor would have rather just lived a â€œnormalâ€\\x9d life, with the occasional run through the woods in her furry suit. Still, Honor was raised to put the welfare of the pack firstâ€¦and now itâ€™s time to make a formal request that the alpha of the Silverback clanâ€”the pack to which all locals owe fealtyâ€”recognize her as alpha of the White Paw. But instead of sending his support, the Silverbacks send Logan Hunter.,Logan Hunter would do anything to protect the Silverbacksâ€”but his devotion comes with a price. For years he has been fighting his alpha instincts and the need for his own pack. But all that changes when Logan is sent on a mission to find out whether the new White Paw alpha really has what it takes to carry on her fatherâ€™s legacy. Powerful, spirited, and downright gorgeous Honor exceeds his expectationsâ€¦and leaves him howling for more. Could it be that heâ€™s finally found his alpha mate? Or will old enemies, dueling loyalties, and an appetite for destruction stop him dead in his tracks?',\n",
